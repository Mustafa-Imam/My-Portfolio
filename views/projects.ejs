        <p>I have done several python projects including Object Oriented Programming and creating programs such as "Calculator" or
        "Name Finder" and etc. I also did a Keyboard Detection Authentication System Project over the summer for the Special 
        Topics of IoT course. Me and my group members developed an authentication system that works based on verifying the user's keyboard
        touch pattern by taking into account factors such as hold time and lift-off time between each key button. This way, even
        if the correct password is entered, only the user with the best keyboard pattern (the one that matches the user's 
        specific keyboard typing style) will be able to gain access to the user's system. 

        We implemented this system by using Machine Learning by training our program. We told the model to take in 100 inputs of
        the user's unique typing pattern and style for a specific password, which was typed by 3 other group members. The model
        was able to differentiate between the bogus users' typing pattern and the authentic user's typing password for the same
        password that was typed. This was done using a percentage bar with a success point of 95%. In other words, whichever
        user's unique typing pattern and style matched either 95% or more with the actual authentic user's typing pattern and
        style, then that specific user would be authenticated and thus would be able to access the system.

        This project of ours proved to be very successful and effective at authenticating the desired user's identity through a
        very sophisticated keyboard typing pattern detection system. We had a blast doing this project and are very happy it
        turned out to be successful!
